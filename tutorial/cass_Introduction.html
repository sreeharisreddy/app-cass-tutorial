<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
<h5>Apache Casandra is</h5>
 <pre>1. a open source </pre>
 <pre>2.A No SQL database technology </pre>
 <pre>3.Distributed technology (will run on multiple servers)</pre>
 <pre>3.Big Data Technology which provides massive scalability</pre>
 <pre>4.Commonly used to create a database that is spread across multiple nodes in more than one data center ,for high availability</pre>
 <pre>5.Based on amazon dynamo and google Big Ta0ble (used for storing huge amount of data) </pre>
 <pre>6.Check cassandra.apache.org</pre>
 <pre>7.Cassandra is fault tollerant , performance will not be degraded if we added additional nodes, And no worry about if master node going down stooping the work.
  Casssandra can run commodity hardware</pre>
  <pre>8.Casandra will be good to suitable for No sql , real time applications. It is not like hadoop which works on batch</pre>
 <pre>9.Also cassandra used in IOT and machine learning</pre>
 <h5>Hardware Requirements</h5>
 <pre>1.64 bit Operating system</pre>
 <pre>8 GB or more ram</pre>
 <pre>30 GB of (ore more) of free harddisk space</pre>
 <pre>VM Ware player</pre>
 <h5>Cassandra Database</h5>
 <pre>A network group of nodes is called cluster.In a cluster there is no master or slave nodes.
 Each node has same functionality as others which combines with replication which allows 
 for distributed data and no single point of failure </pre>
 <pre>In cassandra a cluster can easily be across  more than one data center</pre>
 <pre>Datastax is orgnization which maintains casandra and also have enterprice version </pre>
 <pre><b>Snitch </b> Is how the nodes in a cluster know about the topology of the cluster i.e which nodes in which data center,
 and in data center which nodes in which rack.They find through the Snitch. </b></pre>
 <pre><b>Ways to define Snitch</b></pre>
 <pre>1.Dynamic Snitching</pre>
 <pre>2.SimpleSnitch: will be used in if ther cluster is in Same data center</pre>
 <pre>3.RackinferringSnitch</pre>
 <pre>4.Property File Snitch : Used in the case of cluster is less size . Because in casandra cluster the config file
  contains IP address of all the nodes in the cluster .</pre>
 <pre>5.GossipingPropertyFileSnitch:if the cluster size more then we can use GassipSnitch.
 <b>  Gassip</b> is how the nodes in a cluster communicate with each other.Every one second, each node communicates with up to three other nodes.
 Exchanging information about itself and all the other nodes that it has information about . 
 Gassip is the internal communication method for nodes in a cluster to talk to each other.
 For external communication , such as from an application to a Cassandra database , CQL or Thrift are used.

 <pre>7.Ec2MultiRegionSnitch</pre>
<h5>How data gets distributed</h5>
 <pre><b>Data distribution</b> is done through consistent hashing , to strive for even distribution of data across the nodes in a cluster.</pre>
 <pre>To distribute the rows across the nodes , a partitioner is used. The partitioner use an algorithm to determines which node a given row data will goto.</pre>
 <pre>The default partioner in  cassandra is MURMUR3. It takes the first column in the row and to generate a unique number between -2 pow 63 to +2 pow 63 . 
 It is also possible to use more than one column</pre>
 <pre>Each node in a cluster is assigned one token range (or multiple ranges with virtual nodes) . 
 We will specify the  range manually. To caliculate the range we can use MURMUR3 caliculator</pre>
 <pre>http://murmur3.onthe.io/</pre>
 <pre><b>A replication factor<b/> Must be specified whenever database is defined.It's good to specify 2 or 3</pre>
 <pre><b>Virtual Nodes </b> are an alternative way to assign token ranges to nodes,and are now the default in cassandra.</pre>
 <pre>With virtual nodes ,instead of a node being responsible for just one token range ,it is instead responsible for many small token ranges.
 (by default 256 of them ,for power full computer it can be 512 and less power computer it can be 128)</pre>
