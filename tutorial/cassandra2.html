 <pre><b>CQL</b></pre>
 <pre>>1.Cql is same like , it is same as case sensitive</pre>
 <pre>2.Even though CQL is same like SQL , it's not have all options as sql ,due to the distributed nature of cassandra database.</pre>
 <pre>Example we dont have joins</pre>
 <pre>https://docs.huihoo.com/apache/cassandra/datastax/CQL-3.1-for-Cassandra-2.0-and-2.1.pdf</pre>
 <pre>https://docs.datastax.com/en/dse/5.1/cql/cql/cql_reference/cql_commands/cqlCommandsTOC.html</pre>
 <pre>we can also use cqlsh commands in cql
 
 Example 1. 
 
 cqlsh> describe cluster
		    Cluster: Test Cluster
			Partitioner: Murmur3Partitioner
			Snitch: SimpleSnitch
			 
 cqlsh> HELP   /list all the availble commands
 cqlsh>  HELP SELECT_TABLE /to see the individual command help
 ; optional for cqlsh , but mandatory for cql
 </pre>
 <pre><b>Cassandra Database</b></pre>
 <pre>In casandra a database is defined as keyspace . With in the keyspace the tables can be defined.</pre>
<pre>After installing casssandra we will get some default key spaces system key spaces</pre>
<pre>cqlsh> describe keyspaces
            system  system_traces
cqlsh> describe keyspace system  /list all the table create script and keyspace create script            
cq

NetworkTopologyStratogy : WHich used when the database is spread accross multiple datacenters.
SimpleStrategy : One datacenter
replicationfactor : Each datacenter how many replications of the rows of the keyspace have . So we should have atleast that many nodes in each data center.

CREATE KEYSPACE  vehicle_tracker with REPLICATION = {'class' : 'NetworkTopologyStrategy','dc1' : 3, 'dc2' : 2};

CREATE KEYSPACE  vehicle_tracker with REPLICATION = {'class' : 'refplication_factor' : 1};

by default all the keyspace names become lowercase , if we need upper case specify the keyspace name in "" ex "Vehicle_tracker"

cqlsh> create KEYSPACE vehicle_tracker WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':1};
cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system  vehicle_tracker  system_traces

cqlsh> describe keyspace vehicle_tracker 

CREATE KEYSPACE vehicle_tracker WITH replication = {
  'class': 'SimpleStrategy',
  'replication_factor': '1'
};

drop keyspace keyspace_name;
</pre>
<pre><b>Create Table</b></pre>
<pre>CAQL DATA TYPES
Asci , bigint ,blob ,boolean ,counter,decimal ,double, float,inet,int,list,map,set,text,timestamp,uuid,timeuuid,varchar,varint
we can define primay after the column name or at the end.
Partitioner key is hashed by the partitioner which node of the cluster will store the partition
Partioner key is the value in the primary key defenation ,if have compisiot key the first column is the partion key. partion or row key is the same.<pre></pre>
A table can be defined to store its data in ascending or descending order default is ascending order .
with clustering order by (column desc) . Specifying desc will take loger time to insert ,because cells should added ayt the start of the partion rather end.
But it improves read performance when desc order is required. 
Although adding a new columns is allowed , change the column name on cluster is not recomanded (because of the data needs to be writed again with the new order).

cqlsh:home_security> create TABLE activity (home_id text,datetime timestamp,event text,code_used text, 
 PRIMARY KEY (home_id, datetime))
 WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (datetime DESC);
 
 create table home(home_id text ,address text,alt_phone text ,city text,contact_name text,email text,guest_code text,main_code text,phone text ,phone_password text,state text,
                 zip text,PRIMARY KEY (home_id));
</pre>                 
<pre> <b>Different ways  to insert the data </b>
   1.INSERT into command 
   2.COPY  command / to import csv and export to csv from casandra
   3.sstableloader tool  /to load bulk data , streams sstable to the live cluster ,sstable is the format which cosandra to store on the disk.
     to use sstableloade the data should be oin the sstable format.
 <code>
 cqlsh:home_security> insert into activity(home_id,datetime,code_used,event) VALUES ('H01474777','2014-05-21 07:32:16','5599','alaram set');
 cqlsh:home_security> select * from activity;
  home_id   | datetime                 | code_used | event
-----------+--------------------------+-----------+------------
 H01474777 | 2014-05-21 07:32:16-0700 |      5599 | alaram set
 
 cqlsh:home_security> copy activity (home_id,datetime,event,code_used) from '/home/vm1/Desktop/Files/Chapter 7/events.csv' 
                      WITH HEADER = true AND delimiter = '|';
 
</code>     

</pre>                 
<pre>1. In CQL ,a row's primary key value is what makes it unique.
2. Internally , a partition key value (in thrift ,referred to as a row key value)
is what makes an internal storage row unique.
</pre>
<pre>To view  how the data is stored in Cassandra , cassandra-cli can be used.</pre>
<pre>bin/cassandra-cli</pre>
<code>
[default@home_security] LIST activity;  / dispalyed as per the partition key
Using default limit of 100
Using default cell limit of 100
-------------------
RowKey: H01474777
=> (name=2014-05-23 18\:28\:41-0700:, value=, timestamp=1541852650310000)
=> (name=2014-05-23 18\:28\:41-0700:code_used, value=35353939, timestamp=1541852650310000)

<h5>How data is stored on Disk</h5>
<pre>Whenn data is written to a table in cassandra , it goes to both a commit log on disk
(for playback in case of node failure) and to memory (called memcache) </pre>
<pre>WRITE-------------------------->MEMCACHE
                        |                |
                        |                |(when the mem cache full)
                     COMMITLOG         SSTABLE
 Once the memcache is full , it is flushed to disk ,as an SSTable. Each table on each node there is a memcache. 
 The SSTables for a table are stored on disk , in the location specified in the cassandra.yaml file .(By default ,in the /var/lib/cassandra/data directory.)
 TO see the contents of an SSTable , sstable2json can be used.
 bin/sstable2json /var/lib/cassandra/data/home_security/activity/home_security-activity-jb-1-Data.db
 </pre>
 <pre>When you see the files under /var/lib/cassandra/data/home_security  there would no files created , because the data is still in memcache.Normally it will flush after the memcache is full .
 We can also do manually by applying the below command.
 <strong>bin/nodetool flush home_security</strong>
 <p>bin/sstable2json /var/lib/cassandra/data/home_security/activity/home_security-activity-jb-1-Data.db will display the data in which is stored in jsonformat</p> 
  </pre>
<h5>Data Modeling in Cassnadra</h5>
<pre>1.When data modeling in cassandra , it is important to understand the implications of working with a distributed database versus a relation one.
2.The fact that <b>Joins do not exist</b> in Cassandra is perhaps the most significant data modeling difference between a distributed database versus a relational database.
Because in the distributed database data will be spread accross the nodes and it is difficult to join the different tables .
3.As a result , data modeling in a Cassandra database needs to be done in a way so that all the data for a query is available in one table.
 That means query results can be handled by single table , so it is required what are the queries need then define the table.So that query can be answered by single table.
</pre>
<pre>As Casandra is distributed database with the data organized by partition key , WHERE clause queries generally need to include a partition key.
      select * from activity where home_id='H0147477';
      but the below query does not work
      cqlsh:home_security> select * from activity where code_used='5599';
        Bad Request: No indexed columns present in by-columns clause with Equal operator
</pre>
<pre><b>Indexes</b>
  BY creating an index for columns beyond the partition and clustering columns , values in these other columns can be referenced in WHERE clauses.
  We call these as secondary indexes.
  For each index , Cassandra creates a hidden table on each node in the cluster.
  It is important to know that , contrary to indexes in relational databases , creating secondary indexes does not increase the speed of queries in Cassandra.
  Secondary indexes simply make it so that where clauses that reference values in column beyond the primary and clustering columns can run.
  For increasing the speed of the query , instead of defining a secondary index , you could create a table specifically for the query.
    create table homes_by_state (state text,zip text,home_iid text,address text,primary key (state,zip,home_id)). The drawback with this approach we have to insert and modify the data .
</pre>
<pre>
cqlsh:home_security> create index code_used_index on activity (code_used);
cqlsh:home_security> select * from activity where code_used='5599';

 home_id   | datetime                 | code_used | event
-----------+--------------------------+-----------+------------------
 H01474777 | 2014-05-23 18:28:41-0700 |      5599 | alarm turned off
 H01474777 | 2014-05-23 07:44:23-0700 |      5599 |        alarm set

</pre>
<pre><b>composite partition key</b>
  A composite partition key is where a partition key is made up of more that on column.
  Composite primary key is a good use case for time series data. 
  create table location(vehicle_id text,date text,time timestamp,latitude double,longitude double, PRIMARY KEY((vehicle_id,date),time)) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (time DESC);
  copy location (vehicle_id,date,time,latitude,longitude) from '/home/vm1/Desktop/Files/Chapter 8/coordinates.csv' with HEADER=true and delimiter= '|';
</pre>
<pre> bin/cassandra-cli
use vehicle_tracker
 list location
Using default limit of 100
Using default cell limit of 100
-------------------
RowKey: ME100AAS:2014-05-19
 => (name=2014-05-19 08\:50\:00-0700:, value=, timestamp=1541915499646000)
=> (name=2014-05-19 08\:50\:00-0700:latitude, value=40465fecb31c219f, timestamp=1541915499646000)

 /If you see Rowkey it contains both vehicle id and date as partition key.
